## Documentation  
The game uses the [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) game framework:
* [Phaser official documentation](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.Group.html)
* [Rex’s “notes” about Phaser3](https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/game/)

### Scene structure  
Inside Phaser [Scenes](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scene.html), the game uses custom `Card` instances.
- __Card__ : A card represents a shot in a given scene. Where a scene can be an entire sequence (like a day in one of our character's life),
 a card is rather a still (or animated) frame in said scene. Cards can either be static (in which case they are simply an instance of the `Card` class) or they can be animated (in which case they are a subclass of the `Card` class).  
 - __CardObject__ : Cards are composed of multiple `CardObject` instances, which are given to the card via the `children` field of the constructor. _Card objects_ are what we will be animating in our scene. This can be done in the `create` method of our card class using Phaser [tweens](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tweens.Tween.html).  
 - __Background__ : An other element of our scene is the `background`, which is simply a wrapper for an image that takes up the entire screen and ontop of which we can place `CardObject` instances.  

### Dialogue  
All of the dialogue in our game is handled by our custom `DialogueController`. This uses the dialogue tree defined in a JSON file and converts it to displayable text.   
See [example.json](src/dialogue/en/example.json)  

### Database
If users agree to anonymously share their choices, they get saved in a SQLite database (see [server](server) folder).

### Local game state saves
Game states gets regularly saved in localStorage (see [player.js](src/core/player.js)). This allows players to resume an interrupted game.
